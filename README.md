# 🗂️ File Explorer Application (LinuxOS)

### 📘 Overview
The **File Explorer Application** is a **console-based C++ project** that interacts directly with the **Linux operating system** to manage files and directories.  
It provides a simple **menu-driven interface** where users can perform common file management tasks such as listing, navigating, creating, deleting, copying, renaming, searching, and managing file permissions.

This project is developed as part of **Assignment 1 (LinuxOS)** in the Operating Systems Laboratory.
